  - Branching
  - Pull
  - estimate gas for tx
  - rewrite fetch: don't load all remote commits, just one by one, until you hit one which already exists
  - rm
  - git add and git3 add -> difference between index files. Don't know why yet

  - origin: url of repo is stored in .git/config


  In add we are checking if there is a conflict and if there is, we reject the file. But we somehow have to create a
  commit with two parents. How does that work? How does git know that there should be a commit with two parents?
   - Git add worked, even there is a conflict
   - Git doesn't do anything to prevent it...
